# SocketTaskManager

A multi-client, socket-based task management server built in **pure Java** using **clean layered architecture** and **SQLite (JDBC)** for persistence.

This project was built to deeply understand:
- Backend system design
- Stateful vs stateless components
- Concurrency and shared state
- Raw JDBC (no ORM, no frameworks)
- Manual dependency injection

---

## 🚀 Features

- Multiple clients can connect simultaneously (thread pool based)
- Session-based authentication (per client connection)
- Create tasks with ownership
- Task visibility based on user (creator / assignee ready)
- Persistent storage using SQLite
- Clean separation of concerns (presentation, service, domain, repository)

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

The system follows a **layered architecture**:


Client (telnet)
↓
ClientHandler (socket I/O, per client)
↓
CommandParser (text → command)
↓
CommandExecutor (business rules)
↓
TaskServer (application logic)
↓
TaskRepository (persistence abstraction)
↓
SQLite (via JDBC)



### Key design principles:
- **Stateful per client**: `UserSession`
- **Stateless services**: `CommandExecutor`
- **Shared state**: `TaskServer` (thread-safe)
- **Persistence isolated** in repository layer

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Java** (no frameworks)
- **Sockets (TCP)**
- **ExecutorService** for concurrency
- **SQLite**
- **JDBC (manual, no ORM)**


## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SocketTaskManager.git
cd SocketTaskManager

### 2. Add SQLite JDBC Driver

Download `sqlite-jdbc-<version>.jar` from:

https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/releases

Add it to IntelliJ:


Project Structure → Modules → Dependencies → + → JARs or directories

### 3. Run the server

Run `MainServer.java`.

You should see:

```
Server started on port 9000
```

---

### 4. Connect using telnet

```bash
telnet localhost 9000
```

---

## 💬 Supported Commands

```
LOGIN <username>
LOGOUT
CREATE_TASK <title>
LIST_TASKS
HELP
QUIT
```

### Example session:

```
login wasi
create_task do laundry
list_tasks
logout
```

## 🧠 Key Learning Outcomes

This project intentionally avoids frameworks to understand:

* Why repositories exist
* How JDBC actually works
* Why databases should generate IDs
* How servers manage per-client state
* How concurrency affects shared data
* How clean architecture enables easy changes

---

## 🧪 Persistence Behavior

* Tasks are stored in `taskserver.db`
* Data survives server restarts
* Schema is initialized automatically at startup
* IDs are generated by the database (`AUTOINCREMENT`)

---

## 📌 Why This Project Exists

This project was built as a **learning-focused backend system**, not a demo app.

The goal was to:

* Think like a backend engineer
* Debug real runtime failures
* Design before coding
* Understand what frameworks hide

---

## 🔮 Possible Extensions

* Task assignment (`ASSIGN_TASK`)
* Task status transitions
* User persistence
* Graceful server shutdown
* REST API layer on top of sockets
